    <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
    <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522525.Mistakes_Were_Made_But_Not_by_Me_" target="_blank"><i>Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts</i> by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson</a></h3>
    <p>An introduction to cognitive dissonance theory and its effects in everyday life. </p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25131230-rationality" target="_blank"><i>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</i> by Eliezer Yudkowsky</a></h3>
    <p>A collection of Yudkowsky's blog posts on LessWrong about philosophy of rationality. Being a collection of blog posts, this "book" reads more like a very long rough draft in need of serious downsizing. Nevertheless, it had a big impact on my own philosophy of life.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42041926-the-scout-mindset" target="_blank"><i>The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don't</i> by Julia Galef</a></h3>
    <p>Galef's first book, which nicely summarizes her philosophy of life. Galef makes a distinction between two broad epistemic approaches: "soldier mindset", in which held ideas are defended, and "scout mindset", in which ideas are adopted and discarded based on their accuracy. Galef argues that although the soldier mindset has many short-term benefits, the scout mindset is ultimately a better approach.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens" target="_blank"><i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i> by Yuval Noah Harari</a></h3>
    <p>An excellent big-picture look at human history.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits" target="_blank"><i>Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones</i> by James Clear</a></h3>
    <p>Part theory, part self-help guide. This is an excellent framework for habit formation. I've read it several times.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species" target="_blank"><i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i> by Charles Darwin</a></h3>
    <p>Often simply referred to as "The Origin of Species". A remarkably approachable founding document of science, in which a compelling theory of evolutionary biology is presented.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup" target="_blank"><i>The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses</i> by Eric Ries</a></h3>
    <p>Ries presents a scientific framework for startups, which he generalizes to mean any endeavour under circumstantial uncertainty. While the book is aimed at an audience of business entrepreneurs, this book contains a lot of insights that I have applied to my open source projects.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92057.The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X"><i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> by Malcolm X and Alex Haley</a></h3>
    <p>Malcolm X was a key figure of the civil rights movement in the United States. This book is an incredibly self-aware narrative of his life, as told to Alex Haley over 3 years of interviews, which were cut short by his assassination in 1965.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25387895-the-confidence-game" target="_blank"><i>The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It&mldr;Every Time</i> by Maria Konnikova</a></h3>
    <p>The psychology of confidence games.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36681909-conspiracy" target="_blank"><i>Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue</i> by Ryan Holiday</a></h3>
    <p>A detailed look at a real conspiracy. Had it gone off without a hitch, it would have been completely invisible and this book would have never been written. This book gave me a deep appreciation for how unlikely large-scale conspiracies are, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" target="_blank">Hanlon's razor</a>.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7618917-nonsense-on-stilts" target="_blank"><i>Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk</i> by Massimo Pigliucci</a></h3>
    <p>An examination of pseudoscience and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem" target="_blank">demarcation problem</a>.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow" target="_blank"><i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> by Daniel Kahneman</a></h3>
    <p>An overview of Kahneman and Tversky's research on human psychology. This book popularized the dichotomy of thought: the automatic "System 1" and the deliberate "System 2" processes.</p>
    <h2>Fiction</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-the-mistborn-saga" target="_blank"><i>The Mistborn Saga</i> by Brandon Sanderson</a></h3>
    <p>My favorite series within Sanderson's <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/what-is-the-cosmere" target="_blank">Cosmere universe</a> and an excellent showcase of his <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law" target="_blank">"hard magic"</a>.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17863.Accelerando" target="_blank"><i>Accelerando</i> by Charles Stross</a></h3>
    <p>Showcase of transhumanist concepts from the turn of the millennium. Stross was hopelessly off-base with the rate and direction of technological advancement, but it's a lot of fun comparing the hope to the reality only two decades later.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984" target="_blank"><i>1984</i> by George Orwell</a></h3>
    <p>An alternative-timeline dystopia in which the social sciences surpassed technological advancement, bringing about a sort of post-scientific dark age.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28589297-unsong" target="_blank"><i>Unsong</i> by Scott Alexander</a></h3>
    <p>A "kabbalah punk" adventure of Jewish mysticism, apocalypse, and terrible puns. Currently unpublished, but available in rough-draft at <a href="https://unsongbook.com" target="_blank">unsongbook.com</a>.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16200.Ella_Minnow_Pea" target="_blank"><i>Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters</i> by Mark Dunn</a></h3>
    <p>Fun constrained writing concept. The book is a series of letters between inhabitants of the fictional island of Nollop. As the story goes on, letters of the alphabet are being banned from use one-by-one, forcing the characters (and author) to get very creative with their choice of words.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris" target="_blank"><i>Solaris</i> by Stanis≈Çaw Lem</a></h3>
    <p>A unique first contact story about a sentient ocean, scientists trying to study said ocean, and dead people returning to life to haunt said scientists.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54479.Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days" target="_blank"><i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> by Jules Verne</a></h3>
    <p>Trope codifier of the epic race story. Phileas Fogg wagers his fortune that he can travel around the globe in 80 days. One of my favorites of Verne's.</p>
